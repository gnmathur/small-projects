This is The Allusionist, in which I, Helen Zaltzman, have been learning about and talking about language for ten years. A full ten years since this show launched with two episodes about bras and puns. So much has happened in pod land over that ten years. There was a boom? Podcasts getting bought for tens of millions of dollars? But not this one. Then after the boom, the bust, companies and shows perished. But not this one. Still hoofing along. To celebrate this decade-versary, I am taking a break. The show will be back in early May 2025 with new episodes. Also if there are any topics from the past episodes that you would like me to revisit, let me know. I've got some exciting updates already bubbling away. Also during the break, there will be an illusionist piece called Souvenirs broadcasting on BBC Radio 4 sometime in March. And there will be the return of my other podcast Answer Me This, with new episodes the last Thursday of each month. And things will be keeping lively in The Allusioverse throughout the break, with fortnightly relaxing livestreams with me and my dictionaries, including one this weekend which is open to all at youtube.com/illusionistshow. But with paying members of the Allusioverse, we are watching the new season of Great Pottery Throwdown together and soon we're going to watch Cold Comfort Farm. And we socialise in the Allusioverse Discord community where members are designing their own heraldic coats of arms, they're learning weaving, they're sharing podcasts and TV and book recommendations and supporting one another through this existence. Join us via theallusionist.org/donate. And if you just want to sign up on a free account, you will get very occasional email updates from me about what is happening with the show. So if you want to be reminded in May that this show still exists, that's another option. Today's episode is in the Tranquillusionist style, to give your brain a break while I say words that are not too consequential over a soothing backing track. And this time the words are all the randomly selected words from the dictionary, from every episode of the show, in reverse chronological order. If you've never made it to the end of an episode, you've missed all the randomly selected words from the dictionary, but here they are united. As always, there is a transcript of the episode at theallusionist.org, and if you are curious about any of the spellings, head over there.

Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this show for the past 10 years. Squarespace is our one-stop shop for building a website using their award-winning design templates and adding all the features we want to it, and choosing a custom domain. I have been having some fun with their Domain Name Generator, where you give it some cues and it suggests possible names for your project and how much those domains cost. I put in Entertainment Podcast about language to see what it came up with, and it gave me a bunch of options in several categories, neutral, playful, professional, friendly, informative and quirky. Now, the neutral ones are a bit too neutral, although I was surprised that thewordpodcast.chat is available, and Language Explorers, they also had Language Sexplorers, which is a different show, different kind of entertainment. But I was quite taken with some of the friendly options, Language Buddies and Language Bunnies. And quirky included Grammatango and Wordplay Wonderland, which are pretty charming.

Love to shout out a local Canadian clothing company. They are precious, and I want to support them with my money. Let me be real with you about podcast advertising. Sometimes the sponsors give us some of their products for free so we can talk about our experiences with them. A few months ago, I went along to Understance's flagship store in downtown Vancouver. They gave me a proper bra fitting for the first time in my life, which was revelatory. They let me try on multiple bras and then gifted me some to take home. Here's how much I liked those bras. I then bought more of them with my actual money. Because if you find a good bra, you want duplicates, you want triplicates, you want to be set for years. Check out Understance's wares at understance.com. There is a quiz you can do to find your right bras. They also have super soft cotton sleepwear and underwear, including bike shorts, for chafing protection in summer and giving your bum and thighs a bit of extra warmth in winter.
